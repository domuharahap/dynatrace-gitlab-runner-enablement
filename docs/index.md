# GitLab CI + Dynatrace — Hands-On Enablement

!!! example ""
    ![Workshop Banner](img/framework_banner.png){ align=center }

## About this Workshop

This hands-on workshop teaches you how to build a complete CI/CD pipeline with **GitLab CI** and observe it with **Dynatrace** — starting from an empty GitLab.com account and ending with a Node.js application that builds, tests, scans, containerizes, and deploys itself to Kubernetes, gated by automated quality and load-test checks.

Everything runs inside a single **GitHub Codespace**: the Kubernetes cluster (k3d), the GitLab Runner, SonarQube, and the Dynatrace OneAgent all live in the same container — there is nothing to install on your laptop.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this workshop you will be able to:

- [x] Create a **GitLab.com** project and connect it to your Codespace over SSH
- [x] Install and register a **GitLab Runner** by hand, and reason about executor types and tags
- [x] Build, test, and lint a **Node.js** application (`kkm-pulse-demo`) in a real pipeline
- [x] Add **SAST** and **SonarQube** static analysis quality gates to the pipeline
- [x] Build a **Docker image** in CI and load it into the local Kubernetes cluster (no registry needed)
- [x] Deploy the application to Kubernetes from GitLab CI and reach it from a browser
- [x] Send **Dynatrace deployment events** and load-test results from the pipeline via the Events API v2
- [x] Split the pipeline into **dev** and **prod** stages with an automated gate that blocks a bad build from reaching production
- [x] Validate every production deployment with **Site Reliability Guardian** — KPI and security vulnerability objectives — and auto-rollback via a Dynatrace Workflow if production degrades after the pipeline finishes

## The Demo App — `kkm-pulse-demo`

A small Express.js app simulating a hospital pulse-monitoring dashboard, used as the workshop's running example across all six use cases:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | Serves the dashboard UI |
| `GET /api/status` | Returns simulated clinic status JSON |
| `GET /api/trigger-anomaly` | Spikes CPU for 3s — great for showing Davis AI anomaly detection |

Source lives at [.devcontainer/apps/kkm-pulse-demo](https://github.com/domuharahap/dynatrace-gitlab-runner-enablement/tree/main/.devcontainer/apps/kkm-pulse-demo) inside this repository — you'll push a copy of it to your own GitLab project in Use Case 2.
