# Use Case 4 — Dynatrace Events & Load Testing

`kkm-pulse-demo` now deploys itself to Kubernetes on every pipeline run. Let's make Dynatrace aware of it: install the OneAgent, mark every deployment with a **Dynatrace event**, run a small **load test** from the pipeline, and push the test result back into Dynatrace as another event.

---

## 1. Deploy the Dynatrace Operator and OneAgent

These helper functions are already loaded in your Codespace shell (they read `DT_ENVIRONMENT`, `DT_OPERATOR_TOKEN`, and `DT_INGEST_TOKEN` from the Codespace secrets you set at launch):

```bash
dynatraceDeployOperator
deployApplicationMonitoring
```

!!! info "Why Application Monitoring, not Cloud Native Full Stack?"
    Cloud Native Full Stack needs privileged host-level access that isn't available on the `k3d`-based `enablement` cluster this workshop uses. Application Monitoring injects the OneAgent into your app's container at Pod startup instead — no host access required.

OneAgent injection only happens **at Pod creation**, so restart the Deployment you already have running so the next Pod picks it up:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment/kkm-pulse-demo -n kkm-pulse-dev
kubectl rollout status deployment/kkm-pulse-demo -n kkm-pulse-dev
```

Give it a minute, then generate some traffic and check Dynatrace:

```bash
curl -H "Host: kkm-pulse-dev.127.0.0.1.sslip.io" http://localhost/api/status
```

In Dynatrace, go to **Applications & Microservices → Processes** (or search `kkm-pulse-demo`) — you should see a new Node.js process group appear within a couple of minutes.

---

## 2. Give the pipeline Dynatrace credentials

In the `kkm-pulse-demo` project: **Settings → CI/CD → Variables → Add variable**

| Key | Value | Mask? |
|---|---|---|
| `DT_ENVIRONMENT` | same value as your Codespace secret, e.g. `https://abc123.apps.dynatrace.com` | No |
| `DT_INGEST_TOKEN` | same value as your Codespace secret | Yes |

!!! tip "Where do I find the values again?"
    They were provided as Codespaces secrets at launch. From the terminal: `echo $DT_ENVIRONMENT` (don't echo the token to a shared screen — copy it from wherever you originally stored it, or from GitHub's Codespaces secrets settings).

---

## 3. Send a deployment event

The Environment API v2 [events/ingest](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/api-events-v2-post-event) endpoint takes a `CUSTOM_DEPLOYMENT` event. `DT_ENVIRONMENT` is the `.apps.` SSO URL; the ingest API lives on the `.live.` host, so we rewrite it inline.

```yaml title=".gitlab-ci.yaml (append)" linenums="1"
notify-dynatrace-deploy:
  stage: deploy_dev
  tags:
    - shell
  needs:
    - deploy-dev
  script:
    - DT_TENANT=$(echo "$DT_ENVIRONMENT" | sed -E 's/\.apps\./.live./; s#/$##')
    - >
      curl -sf -X POST "${DT_TENANT}/api/v2/events/ingest"
      -H "Authorization: Api-Token ${DT_INGEST_TOKEN}"
      -H "Content-Type: application/json"
      -d "{\"eventType\":\"CUSTOM_DEPLOYMENT\",\"title\":\"kkm-pulse-demo deployed to dev\",\"entitySelector\":\"tag(dt.smartscape.k8s_deployment:kkm-pulse-demo),tag(dt.smartscape.k8s_namespace:kkm-pulse-dev)\",\"properties\":{\"dt.event.deployment.name\":\"kkm-pulse-demo\",\"version\":\"${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}\",\"environment\":\"dev\"}}"
```

Push, run the pipeline, then in Dynatrace open **Notifications & alerting → Events** (or search `deployment.name:kkm-pulse-demo` in the events feed) to see it land — deployment events also draw a marker line on the process's timeline charts.

---

## 4. Run a load test and grade it

No JMeter needed for a small Express API — a short bash/curl loop is enough to produce a real latency/error-rate signal.

```yaml title=".gitlab-ci.yaml (append)" linenums="1"
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - code_quality
  - package
  - deploy_dev
  - load_test

load-test:
  stage: load_test
  tags:
    - shell
  needs:
    - notify-dynatrace-deploy
  script:
    - |
      TARGET="http://localhost/api/status"
      HOST_HEADER="kkm-pulse-dev.127.0.0.1.sslip.io"
      TOTAL=50
      FAIL=0
      SUM_MS=0
      for i in $(seq 1 $TOTAL); do
        RESULT=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -H "Host: ${HOST_HEADER}" -w "%{http_code} %{time_total}" "$TARGET")
        CODE=$(echo "$RESULT" | awk '{print $1}')
        SECS=$(echo "$RESULT" | awk '{print $2}')
        MS=$(awk -v s="$SECS" 'BEGIN{printf "%d", s*1000}')
        SUM_MS=$((SUM_MS + MS))
        [ "$CODE" != "200" ] && FAIL=$((FAIL + 1))
      done
      AVG_MS=$((SUM_MS / TOTAL))
      ERROR_RATE=$((FAIL * 100 / TOTAL))
      echo "Requests: $TOTAL  Failures: $FAIL  Error rate: ${ERROR_RATE}%  Avg latency: ${AVG_MS}ms"
      {
        echo "LOADTEST_TOTAL=$TOTAL"
        echo "LOADTEST_FAIL=$FAIL"
        echo "LOADTEST_ERROR_RATE=$ERROR_RATE"
        echo "LOADTEST_AVG_MS=$AVG_MS"
      } >> loadtest.env
  artifacts:
    reports:
      dotenv: loadtest.env

notify-dynatrace-test-result:
  stage: load_test
  tags:
    - shell
  needs:
    - load-test
  script:
    - DT_TENANT=$(echo "$DT_ENVIRONMENT" | sed -E 's/\.apps\./.live./; s#/$##')
    - >
      curl -sf -X POST "${DT_TENANT}/api/v2/events/ingest"
      -H "Authorization: Api-Token ${DT_INGEST_TOKEN}"
      -H "Content-Type: application/json"
      -d "{\"eventType\":\"CUSTOM_INFO\",\"title\":\"kkm-pulse-demo load test result\",\"properties\":{\"requests\":\"${LOADTEST_TOTAL}\",\"failures\":\"${LOADTEST_FAIL}\",\"error_rate_pct\":\"${LOADTEST_ERROR_RATE}\",\"avg_latency_ms\":\"${LOADTEST_AVG_MS}\",\"commit\":\"${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}\"}}"
    - |
      if [ "$LOADTEST_ERROR_RATE" -gt 10 ]; then
        echo "Error rate ${LOADTEST_ERROR_RATE}% exceeds the 10% budget — failing this job."
        exit 1
      fi
```

`load-test` records its numbers via a [`dotenv` artifact](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/artifacts_reports.html#artifactsreportsdotenv), so `notify-dynatrace-test-result` can read `$LOADTEST_ERROR_RATE` etc. straight from the environment — no need to re-run the test or parse logs.

```bash
git add .gitlab-ci.yaml
git commit -m "ci: dynatrace deployment events and load test"
git push
```

## 5. See Davis AI catch a real anomaly

Trigger the CPU-spike endpoint a few times while watching Dynatrace:

```bash
for i in 1 2 3; do curl -H "Host: kkm-pulse-dev.127.0.0.1.sslip.io" http://localhost/api/trigger-anomaly; done
```

Open **Problems** in Dynatrace — Davis AI should surface a CPU saturation problem correlated to the `kkm-pulse-demo` process within a few minutes, alongside the deployment and load-test events you just pushed on the same timeline.

---

## What "stop a bad build" means here

`notify-dynatrace-test-result` exits non-zero when the error budget is blown. Since it's a downstream `needs` dependency, any stage you add **after** `load_test` (like a production deploy) simply won't start if this job fails — the bad build never leaves dev. Use Case 5 builds exactly that gate.
