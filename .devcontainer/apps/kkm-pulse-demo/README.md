# kkm-pulse-demo

Demo app for the [GitLab CI + Dynatrace hands-on workshop](https://github.com/domuharahap/dynatrace-gitlab-runner-enablement). A small Express.js "hospital pulse monitor" used to exercise a full GitLab CI pipeline: build, test, SAST, SonarQube, Docker build, Kubernetes deploy, Dynatrace events, and a gated dev/prod promotion.
